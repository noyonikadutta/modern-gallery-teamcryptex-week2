# Modern-Gallery

A modern reimagining of a classic PHP image gallery
Small, opinionated, easy to run — but built for today’s web.

What is this?

This project takes inspiration from the old-school, single-file PHP image galleries that powered countless small websites.
It keeps their simplicity and “just works” spirit, but rebuilds the stack with today’s needs in mind:

## Features

- Login & Register with secure backend token support
- Dark mode toggle for light/dark themes
- Drag & drop uploads with preview, title & description
- Gallery browsing with list/album view, sorting, likes & deletion (if owner)
- Pagination & load more for smooth navigation
- Static featured images on the homepage index
- Lightbox viewer for fullscreen image display
- Logout & session management with auto-expiry
- Navbar for consistent navigation
- SEO friendly search bar
